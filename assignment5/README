I would have done a voice over for the video,
however, my mic is not very good at all so this will 
have to do. 

The first thing about my visualization is the volume probe. 
The probe makes the beeping sound as it travels through the volume,
and as the data changes, so does the pitch relative to the normalized data.
You can raise and lower the probe with the arrow keys as well.

On the lefthand side of the screen, I implemented a small UI.
It includes a mute button if the beeping gets too grating and
displays for the probes current data (not normalized) as well as,
what will get me into the next addition, the ribbon data.

I also added a way to control the ribbon visualization.
I had some trouble with the texture of the ribbons, so only the color
is changed and only the color based variable is displayed in the UI.
Additionally, left arrow and right arrow will display only a single
ribbon at a time and that ribbons average color data value will 
be displayed on the left. Hitting tab will reset all to the original
state. I wanted to do more with this, as well as a surface probe,
but I had a lot of issues with the UI and kind of ran out of time on it.

Really, I wanted to do a lot more with this, but this was my first time
using unity (outside of last assignment) and I really got tripped up 
on a lot of things and just didn't have a lot of time in the first 
place so had to settle with this.

Also the data being visualized is velocity magnitude for the ribbons,
O2 for the smoke with a range of 0.2298 to 0.301 and only the lower end
of that range having much visibility (because it looks cool) and raw 
bulk of fuel for the ground variable.
