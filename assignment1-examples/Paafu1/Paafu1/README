Part A: Got it.
    Each island has a circle and name. 
    The name stays a static size so they kind of overlap
     when zoomed out, however, I think this makes it easier
     to find the islands (in addition to other things I added for that)

Part B: Got it.
    The first channel is color and it represents population.
    Darker green is higher population and white is low population. 
    Using the lerpColor and a little finagling, there is a nice gradient
     between the range. 
    I had to mess with the interpolation a bit to get it so that there 
     was a nice gradient because Weno was a big outlier in population,
     and if I just simply used max and min, the gradient did not look
     nearly as good.
    The other channel is the size of the island circles. This is based
     off of the area of each island. There are a few islands that overlap,
     however, I wanted the bigger ones to still be relatively visible when
     zoomed out and the only way I could do that is making them bigger.
     
Part C: Got it.
    In addition to a legend, I also added two other tabs. 
    The first tab lists the island from the most populated down to the least
     populated. Each island can be clicked on and an arrow will show on the 
     map pointing you to it. The second tab lets you change the census
     year. Additionally, when clicked on an island in the islands tab, 
     the population of that island for the year is in the last box of the years tab.
    The area is now also added.
    Also I thought it would be cool to make the legend move around as you open the tabs
     so I did :)
    I couldn't really figure out how to add an objective view of how the size changes
     with area to the legend without just putting every island there, so I simply stated
     that size changes with area, and also added a way to see the exact area of every 
     island.
